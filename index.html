            <p>We have all been the recipient of spam emails before. Spam mail, or junk mail, is a type of email that is sent to a massive number of users at one time, frequently containing cryptic messages, scams, or most dangerously, phishing content.

              In this Project, I used Python to build an email spam detector. Then, I  used machine learning to train the spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam.</p>
